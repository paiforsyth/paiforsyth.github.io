Our machine learning and finance reading group is currently focusing on deep hedging, a technique applying machine learning techniques to the classic quantitative finance problem of hedging a derivative in an incomplete market.   You can find slides from past talks [here](https://github.com/paiforsyth/ML-Finance_Group). Iâ€™ve re-recorded my own talk, which draws on a few papers I have read recently to discuss the application of deep hedging to problems with transaction costs.  The video is [here](https://youtu.be/F6NZmhnP_ho).
