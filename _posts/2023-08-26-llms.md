These questions have been in the air over the past year, but solid data upon which to base an analysis has been scarce.  In a recent talk at our machine learning and finance reading group, I explored these questions by drawing on two sources: first, MIT economist David Autor's analysis of the labor-market impact of past technological changes;  second, a recent case study of the introduction of a language-mode-based tool in a workplace (Erik Brynjolfsson, Danielle Li, and Lindsey R. Raymond. "Generative AI at work". National Bureau of Economics Research Working Paper). While definitive predictions are impossible at this early stage, I hope my discussion provides some useful insights.  I've re-recorded the talk here.
