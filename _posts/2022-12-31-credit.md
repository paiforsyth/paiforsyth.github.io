Sometimes the trickiest questions in ML are unrelated to the design of the learning algorithm. For example: How can we evaluate a new machine learning algorithm when our evaluation dataset is biased by the old algorithm we seek to replace?  How can we evaluate the fairness of our algorithm?
Drawing on the work of Kleinberg, Lakkaraju, Leskovec, Ludwig, and Mullainathan (“Human Decisions and Machine Predictions”, “The Selective Labels Problem”) the paper “Fintech for the Poor: Financial Intermediation Without Discrimination” by Prasanna Tantri is a case study in the application of ML techniques to a finance problem arising in rural India.  The paper grapples with these and other important questions.

I have re-recorded a recent talk I gave at our ML Finance reading group in which I discuss Tantri’s paper.    The video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQdFkVSvWnE).
